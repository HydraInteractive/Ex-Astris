1. How to play
--------------

1.1 Launching the server
------------------------

Launch barcodeserver.exe on your machine of choice, for maximum performance use
a different PC than the one your use for playing.

Don't connect to the server before it prints "Server is now ready for players!"


1.2 Launching the client
------------------------

Launch barcodegame.exe and in the main menu choose 'Play', 'Play COOP' and then
'Join Game'. Enter the address to the server machine, if you are hosting it on
the same PC, use "127.0.0.1", and then press 'OK'. You will now connect to the
server and be able to play the game.
